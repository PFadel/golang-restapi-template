# golang-restapi-template

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/PFadel/golang-restapi-template)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/PFadel/golang-restapi-template)

This is my try at creating a golang-restapi-template for anyone to use. It is entirely based on my own techinal opinion and personal taste, but I will try to explain why I did some things the way I did. I also am open to receive suggestions and (constructive) criticism.

## No-Brainers

Things I believe are no-brainers because most of the community use and are considered good practices so far:

- docker & docker-compose
- go mod
- golangci
- Makefile

That being said, I will now try to speak about my other choices now.

## Other choices

### stdlib net/http

### uber-go/fx
